## Stakeholders
- **Product Owner:** Jane Doe
- **Lead Developer:** John Smith
- **QA Lead:** Priya Patel
- **Key Users/Advisors:** Streamer Community, Internal QA Team

## 1. Purpose
The goal of Webcam Filter App V2 is to deliver a modern, user-friendly, and high-performance webcam effects application for streamers, content creators, and everyday users. V2 will focus on a redesigned GUI, consolidated and more powerful style system, improved device management, and robust configuration and testing infrastructure. This release aims to set a new standard for usability, flexibility, and reliability in real-time webcam filtering.

## 2. Scope
**In Scope:**
- Complete redesign of the GUI for usability and aesthetics
- Consolidation of similar styles (e.g., Cartoon, Sketch, Invert) into unified, variant-driven classes
- Dynamic parameter panels and real-time preview
- Improved device selection and error handling
- Refactored settings/config system
- In-app help/about and documentation
- Automated GUI and style logic tests
- Windows 10+ support

**Out of Scope:**
- macOS/Linux support (future release)
- Cloud-based processing
- Mobile app version

**Out-of-Scope Rationale:**
- Cross-platform and cloud features are deferred to focus resources on delivering a robust, high-quality Windows experience first. Mobile and cloud require separate design and testing efforts.

## 3. User Stories
- As a user, I want to easily select and preview webcam effects so I can find the best look for my stream.
- As a streamer, I need to quickly switch between style variants (e.g., different cartoon modes) without restarting the app.
- As a user, I want to save and load my favorite settings and styles.
- As a user, I want clear error messages if my webcam or virtual camera fails.
- As a new user, I want in-app help and tooltips so I can learn features quickly.
- As a developer, I want automated tests to ensure stability as the app evolves.

## 4. Functional Requirements
- [ ] The app shall provide a modern, tabbed GUI for style selection and parameter adjustment.
- [ ] Users can select from consolidated style groups (e.g., Cartoon, Sketch, Invert) and choose variants via dropdowns.
- [ ] The app shall display a real-time preview of the selected style and parameters.
- [ ] Users can save/load settings and snapshots.
- [ ] The app shall support robust device selection and error feedback for webcams and virtual cameras.
- [ ] In-app help/about section and tooltips for all major controls.
- [ ] Automated tests for GUI and style logic.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Performance: Real-time preview must maintain at least 15 FPS for 720p video on a typical modern laptop CPU.
- [ ] Security: No external network connections; all processing is local.
- [ ] Compatibility: Must run on Windows 10 and 11 (x64).
- [ ] Usability: All major features accessible within 3 clicks from the main window.
- [ ] Reliability: App must recover gracefully from device errors and invalid settings.

## 6. UI/UX Requirements
- [ ] The interface should use a modern, accessible color scheme and clear typography.
- [ ] Style selection must use broad tabs (Artistic, Basic, Distortions, Color Filters) with dropdowns for variants.
- [ ] Parameter panels must update dynamically based on style/variant.
- [ ] Real-time preview area must be prominent and responsive.
- [ ] All controls must have tooltips; help/about section must be accessible from the main window.
- [ ] Keyboard navigation and screen reader support for all major controls.
- [ ] [Wireframes/Mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/your-mockup-link) _(add link when available)_

## 7. Technical Constraints
- [ ] Must use Python 3.9+, PyQt5 (or PySide2), OpenCV 4.x, numpy.
- [ ] Codebase must be modular, with styles in `styles/`, GUI in `src/gui/`, and config in `src/config/`.
- [ ] All new code must include unit or integration tests.
- [ ] No breaking changes to the snapshot or settings file formats without migration support.

## 8. Success Metrics
- [ ] 1000+ downloads in first month post-launch
- [ ] <2% crash rate in first 3 months
- [ ] 90%+ positive user feedback (in-app or online survey)
- [ ] 80%+ test coverage for new code
